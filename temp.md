❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
funtion sum(){ return a+b; }
```

🔍 Issues:

*   ❌ Syntax Error: "funtion" is misspelled; it should be "function."
*   ❌ Missing Parameters: The function expects to add `a` and `b`, but these variables are not defined within the function scope or passed as arguments. This will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

*   ✔ Corrected Spelling: "funtion" is corrected to "function."
*   ✔ Added Parameters: The function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are used in the summation.
*   ✔ Clear Return: The function explicitly returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
